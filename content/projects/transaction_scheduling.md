This project shows how database transactions with continuous execution times and conflicts that prevent execution on different machines can be efficiently scheduled using quantum computing. It includes a comparison of different methods such as Quantum Annealing, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), and Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA).
